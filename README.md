Link To Presentation: [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhdvovyvfr9dm9x/NLP_and_rap_generation.pptx?dl=0)

In excitement for Travis Scotts new album, AstroWorld being released. I set out to train an LSTM to generate rap lyrics, when give a seed.
See the presentation link above for an example output.

Note: Due to explicit language, I removed a large portion of the webscrape links (the data). Add in links to your favorite songs and it will generate lyrics for you!
